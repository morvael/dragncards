# #
# # To get SSL working, you will need to add the `https` key
# # to the previous section and set your `:url` port to 443:
# #
# #     config :dragncards, DragnCardsWeb.Endpoint,
# #       ...
# #       url: [host: "example.com", port: 443],

# #         certfile: System.get_env("SOME_APP_SSL_CERT_PATH")
# #       ]
# #
# # The `cipher_suite` is set to `:strong` to support only the
# # latest and more secure SSL ciphers. This means old browsers
# # and clients may not be supported. You can set it to
# # `:compatible` for wider support.
# #
# # `:keyfile` and `:certfile` expect an absolute path to the key
# # and cert in disk or a relative path inside priv, for example
# # "priv/ssl/server.key". For all supported SSL configuration
# # options, see https://hexdocs.pm/plug/Plug.SSL.html#configure/1
# #
# # We also recommend setting `force_ssl` in your endpoint, ensuring
# # no data is ever sent via http, always redirecting to https:
# #
# #     config :dragncards, DragnCardsWeb.Endpoint,
# #       force_ssl: [hsts: true]
# #
# # Check `Plug.SSL` for all available options in `force_ssl`.
